## Uninstall dependencies with DPM

You can use this flags on the: **uninstall** command and the **clean** alias

| Flags           | Description                             |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| -A, --all [all] | Remove all dependencies from the files! |
| -h, --help      | The CLI help message                    |

DPM doesn't delete any libraries from your computer, it just deletes the
_dpm_imports.json_ file!

For uninstall all dependencies from the _dpm_imports.json_ you need run:

```
dpm uninstall -A
```

For uninstall only one specific dependency you need run:

```
dpm uninstall draco dlog2
```
