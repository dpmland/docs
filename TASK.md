For add a task to the files well you need only run:

dpm task -n
```

And this add the task on the deno.json and the dpm.json file well but if I add a
new task on the dpm.json file how can update this. You need run only this
command

```
dpm task -u
```

You want see what commands you have y this files here are the list in a
beautifull table.

```
dpm task -l deno # For the deno.json file
